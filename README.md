## 🎯 Purpose
I built this Sorting Visualizer web application to:  
- Improve my skills in *HTML, CSS, and JavaScript*.  
- Help beginners in programming gain a deeper understanding of sorting algorithms.  
- Provide a clear, visual way to learn the step-by-step process of sorting.

## 🔢 Algorithms Implemented

This application currently supports the following sorting algorithms, each visualized step by step:

1. 🫧 **Bubble Sort** – Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements to sort the array.  
2. 📥 **Insertion Sort** – Builds the sorted array one element at a time.  
3. 🔍 **Selection Sort** – Selects the minimum element and places it at the correct position.  
4. 🔗 **Merge Sort** – Divides the array and merges sorted subarrays efficiently.  
5. ⚡ **Quick Sort** – Uses divide-and-conquer with a pivot for fast sorting.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

The **Sorting Algo Visualizer App** is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML5** – Provides the structure and semantic layout of the web application.  
- **CSS3** – Handles styling, animations, and responsive design.  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Implements the sorting algorithms and dynamic visualization logic.
